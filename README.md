# Friendly - World letter sending simulator

Friendly is an application that brings back the excitement of sending and receiving letters, but with a modern twist. By simulating the sending of letters around the world, Friendly adds a special layer to the act of old-fashioned communication. With the innovation of considering the distance to the recipient, Friendly offers a unique waiting experience, where the letter takes longer to arrive as the distance increases.

## Key Features

### 1. Realistic Sending Simulation
- Every 18,000 km of distance increases the waiting time for the letter by 24 hours. This adds an exciting and realistic dimension to the sending experience.

### 2. Integrated Geolocation
- Uses the geolocation API to obtain user coordinates, enabling precise calculation of the distance between sender and recipient.

### 3. Personalized Profile
- Customize your profile by adding your photo, information about the languages you speak, and topics of interest. Make the experience of sending and receiving letters even more personal.

## How to Use
